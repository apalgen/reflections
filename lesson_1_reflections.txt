How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows me the old and new version and what has changed, so I can find the (new) bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can experiment with things and try to optimize my code without loosing code because
    I can always go back.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manually in Git gives the user the responsibility. In Google Docs versioning
    is automatically done so you dont forget it.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is for projects with multible files which depend on each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    "git log --stat" and "git diff <firstId> <secondId>"

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always go back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
