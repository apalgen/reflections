When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you want to collaborate with other people on the code or when you want to make it Open Source (like on GitHub).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because it takes the advantage of staying at a current state of the code and work with that fixed state without changing while you are editing and testing it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are a copy  of a Git repository (from an other person) with witch you can work as it would be your own repository.
	Clones are a copy of a Git repository (from an other person) which leaves the remote origin in place and so you need the permission of the owner to push.
	Branches are like many different directions (for the evolving of the project) which often lead (merging) to the same goal.
